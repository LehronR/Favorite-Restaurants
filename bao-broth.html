            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Bao and Broth was dreamt up by Larry Schreiber a Moffett Restaurant Group veteran, as a way to live his desire to create asian street food that is as intricately crafted as it is delicious. Larry was inspired when he was young by Tampopo, a movie that reflects his desire to create the perfect recipe. Through this inspiration Bao and Broth was born. Bao and Broth gives equal care to everything on the menu to create food that is flavorful, thoughtful, and delicious. When it comes to your food Bao and Broth doesnâ€™t play favorites.</p>
