            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Eddie V’s charismatic vibe draws you in and holds you close, invites you to be seen, or sit back and just savor. The finest seafood and steaks. World-class wine and service. And live jazz in the V lounge.  Eddie V’s can be found across the country. While each location is unique in its setting, artwork and décor, they all share an unmistakable elegance. Enjoy a virtual visit now. An in-person visit at your earliest convenience.</p>
            <p>Seafood is what we’re known for, but our specialty is excellence. Fish arrive daily from pristine waters around the world including Swordfish from Block Island, Scallops from George Banks, and YellowFin Tuna from the Caribbean. USDA Prime steaks are hand cut and specially aged for more than 28 days to ensure peak flavor. Devotion to excellence is the guiding principle in all that we do. From making fresh tortillas by hand daily for our lobster tacos to including a full half-pound of Jumbo Lump crab meat in our crab cakes, we strive to go above and beyond in every step of preparation. Our intent: to prepare the finest meal you’ve ever had.</p>
