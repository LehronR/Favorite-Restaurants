        <h1>My Favorite Restaurants in Charlotte, North Carolina</h1>
        <p>From upscale, star rated restaurants to hole in the wall diners, good food can be found in the many places.  As proof to that point, I am sharing my top five favorite restaurants in Charlotte, NC.  No matter what vibe you are feeling, these places are sure to accommodate the right dish to quiet the rumbling of a stomach in need.  In no specific order, my top five restaurants are:</p>

            <h2>MOA</h2>
            <p>When most people think of a Korean barbecue restaurant, I imagine two thoughts coming to mind. One, what is Korean barbecue or two, I don't feel like cooking my own food.  If you fall in to the category of the first thought, allow me to give you a quick description for what Korean barbecue restaurants are.  Picture a typical restaurant table or booth and the cut a hole in the middle and drop a grill into it.  The options when ordering can vary based on location but you generally get two options: have the staff cook your food or cook it yourself on the previously mentioned table grill.  The price of one these meals can vary by as wide a gap as the selection to choose from depending on where you go.  MOA falls into the higher end range based on atmosphere and pricing.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Eddie V's</h2>
            <p>For all the carnivores and seafood lovers, Eddie V's is the place to go.  This restaurant, which happens to be across the street from MOA in uptown Charlotte, is definitely the place you go when you want to live the high life.  Great food centered around a selection of steaks, oysters and seafood dishes and unique drinks like the hope diamond makes this location one of my favorites in the city.  It's not the place you would go to every weekend (unless your bank account allows it) but when you want to treat your loved ones and yourself this should be one or your first considerations to have an elegant night out.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Firebirds</h2>
            <p>Some restaurants hold a special place in your heart and Firebirds, for me, is one of those places.  It's not a location that is going to blow your socks off with glitz and glam but it will make you fall in love once you try the food.  In particular, the only two things I ever order when I go and that keep me anticipating going back.</p>
            <p>Check out the Firebirds breakdown page for more details and my recommended dishes.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Lorenzo's Pizzeria</h2>
            <p>It's pizza...need I say more?  Well, whether I need to or not I am going to.  This is by far the best pizza I have ever had.  I know everyone has a preference but if you are a fan of New York style pizza then Lorenzo's is a must try.  You can buy it by the slice but honestly I would suggest getting a whole pie and saving the gas from making a second trip.</p>
            <p>Check out the Lorenzo's Pizzeria breakdown page for more details and my recommended dishes.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Bao + Broth</h2>
            <p>For fans of asian cuisine, japanese cuisine to be more specific and steamed buns and ramen to be exact, I present Bao + Broth.  The particular location I recommend is located inside of Optimist Hall (It could have a list of it's own for places to eat).  The best way I can describe Bao + Broth's goodness is by letting you know that it is surrounded by over 10 other locations to eat and regardless of what else I get I <span>must</span> have steam buns and ramen in hand before I can leave.  </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Wheew, that was a lot of talking about food without eating anything...mostly.  This list only scratches the surface of the great eateries that Charlotte has to offer.  So, if you ever find yourself hungry in the middle of the city check out one of these locations.  Also, because I would feel disappointed in myself without mentioning some of my other favorite places to eat that just barely missed the to five spots, I included another list of honorable mentions.  You can click here to see those or just click the link called "honorable mentions" in the navigation bar at the top.  </p>
